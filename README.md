# Sliding-Puzzle-Pathfinding 👾🎮

#### This project solves a sliding puzzle where a player navigates from a start (S) to a finish (F) on a grid. The grid contains ice (.) and rocks (0), with the player sliding in the chosen direction until hitting an obstacle or the grid's edge. Implemented in Java , <br> the project includes: <br>

#### 🍄Map Representation: Data structure to model the grid. <br>
#### 🍄Map Parser: Reads the grid from an input file. <br>
#### 🍄Pathfinding Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from S to F. <br>
#### 🍄Output: Detailed steps of the solution. <br>
#### 🍄Report: Explanation, demonstration, and performance analysis. <br>
