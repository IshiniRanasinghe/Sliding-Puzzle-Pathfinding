# Sliding-Puzzle-Pathfinding

Sliding Puzzle Pathfinding
Description:
This project solves a sliding puzzle where a player navigates from a start (S) to a finish (F) on a grid. The grid contains ice (.) and rocks (0), with the player sliding in the chosen direction until hitting an obstacle or the grid's edge. Implemented in Java , the project includes:

Map Representation: Data structure to model the grid.
Map Parser: Reads the grid from an input file.
Pathfinding Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from S to F.
Output: Detailed steps of the solution.
Report: Explanation, demonstration, and performance analysis.
